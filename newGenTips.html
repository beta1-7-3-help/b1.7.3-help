    <h2>New Gen Tips</h2>
    <p>Fun Fact: This webpage started cause i did not know how to craft a button :D</p>
    <p>Here are some things to note Jumping From Modern Minecraft To b1.7.3: <br>
    1. Don't use the vannila Launcher
    2. Hunger is not a thing, Food Works more like an insta-heal item, This is Overpowered <br>
    and to balance this, you can't Stack Food
    3. You can't Sprint, The fastest way to travel is minecarts <br>
    4. Bows are closer to machine guns <br>
    5. You can't put 2 chests next to eachother, you need atleast one block between then <br>
    6. If you are playing on an M-based Mac Computer, Version before 1.6 (including b1.7.3) <br>
    Your colors will be really mesed up (this is refered to as <a href="https://">bluecraft</a>) <br>
    a solution that works for some is forcing your game to fullscreen with cmd+shift+f11 <br>  
    (if you dont have fnlock on (weirdo) you need to press the fn key too)</p>
